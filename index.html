Data and datasets cannot and should not be considered unchanging and unquestionable, as to avoid questioning would be to ignore the possibility that the data is biased. Drucker and Ramsay are in fact the ones who are correct, they believe that as a community Digital Humanists should question the source of information, they believe that blind acceptance of the content being studied can lead to personal bias, incorrect assumptions and factual inaccuracies. <br> <br>
	When examining datasets, it is important to understand that the datasets as well as their questions, methods and results are directly linked to the individual opinions and beliefs that are held by the creator(s) of the study. For example, there was a study done by the investigative news site ProPublica that revealed that a criminal justice algorithm used in Broward county Florida, mislabeled African American citizens as “high-risk” twice as often as it mislabeled white defendants.  (Manyika, Silberg, & Presten, 2019) What this reveals is that despite an algorithm being a computer program supposedly free of human bias and mistakes, the bias of the programmer still leaks through. The way AI develops is by using the training data given to develop and evolve, when the data given for training is biased this will bias the code and resulting AI. As AI becomes more relevant and more developed there will be an increase of usage, especially in the scientific research fields, as the use of Ai will allow studies to be more flexible and applicable to a wider test audience. This is where the practice of taking data at face value and not questioning it becomes an issue, as more and more disciplines look to use AI to carry out studies, the biases these Ais may carry will make themselves more prevalent, and can and will sway the results. “Simons (2007) draws attention to how Jenkins maps the significant roles that narrative can play in games in a way palatable to the ludologists.” (Sinclair & Rockwell) This is from the reading Name Games: Analyzing Game Studies and brings to light a very interesting argument that possibly wasn’t intended. This quote brings the fact that Jenkins maps the roles that narrative plays in a way that game scholars will enjoy. While this is arguably just a statement explaining that the information was presented in a certain way, it can also be argued that this further proves that Data can be presented in many ways and many scholars will present the data collected in a way that is pleasing to their audience which can further bias the results. While personal bias is something that can have huge impacts on data, the blind acceptance of information can also lead to incorrect or false assumptions. <br> <br>
	It is important here to recognize that assumptions in this context refers to certain pieces of information that are received as given, an example of this would be that the sky is blue. When an individual or a group of people is drafting their survey questions, creating the survey or examining the data available in order to understand what questions need answering, they commonly rely on preexisting data, as well as using assumed data as discussed above. The issue that reveals itself at this stage is the quality of the preexisting data, if someone like Moretti’s data was used in order to draft a survey or survey question there is a possibility that the data reported is in fact biased already, and as discussed above, there will inevitably be a personal bias when this survey is created and carried out, so as the survey is carried out the data will become more and more biased and warped. This could however be prevented by following the model presented by Digital Humanists like Drucker and Ramsay, if the researchers checked where the data they were using came from, as well as where the data used to receive that data came from it would allow some of the bias to be cut down almost eliminating it. These assumptions also play into the assumption that we as Digital Humanists don’t have a personal bias, but there was study completed in 2018 that revealed that even the internet is biased “There have been recent studies on the metrics of publication and how that along with citation counts has a clear Anglo-bias, resulting in incentives for advancement, promotion and funding to favor publication in the English language for the Arts and Humanities.” (Mahony, S)  As can be seen, there is a bias even in the assumptions we carry when creating certain projects, an example is the internet, most people assume that the internet is an equal opportunity space, but it is clearly demonstrated by this quote that it is not as “equal” as was previously assumed. Not only can ignorance as to how data is collected lead to personal bias and incorrect assumptions, it can also lead to factual inaccuracies.<br><br>

	Factual inaccuracies will sometimes occur due to a number being mis-recorded, misreported or sometimes due to inaccuracy of data, or personal bias. Should the data to be used be generated by an Ai or an individual who believes that Data and Datasets should not be questioned there will sometimes be places where the information that is finally presented as fact will be incorrect. An example of this would be the ongoing report done by Stephen Lecce. (Dhanraj , 2019) The fact that Stephen Lecce reported was that many families didn’t care about smaller class sizes but rather wanted online classes to be more prevalent. When this survey was actually released it was revealed that the opposite was in fact true, more families wanted smaller class sizes and less people wanted online classes. Lecce tried to use this information as a way to sway relations with the teacher’s unions of Canada. This returns back to the idea that Moretti refuses to examine data, if the teachers unions and the public refused to examine where their information actually came from, some decisions could be made that would have far reaching and impactful repercussions, simply based upon the bias that information is presented through. Overall Moretti is brazenly incorrect in his assumptions that data should not be questioned, and should the Digital Humanities decide to follow in his footsteps almost all information retrieved from DH research would have to be redone as there is guarantee that it was in fact correct or unbiased in any way.

	Digital Humanities is still a relatively young field, and it is an inevitable fact that as it gets older new research methods will reveal themselves, however, as a field DH will be unable to grow if they fail to examine all of the information that is used during their studies. Overall Moretti is wrong, his beliefs that data should not be questioned is incorrect and Moretti and Drucker are correct. Failure to examine our information will lead to personal bias, incorrect assumptions and factual inaccuracies
